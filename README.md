csmxauth
csmxauth is a Post-Quantum Secure Authentication Library designed to help developers integrate secure authentication methods into their applications, using state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques.

Installation
To install csmxauth, you can use pip, the Python package manager:

bash
Copy
pip install csmxauth
You can also install the package directly from GitHub:

bash
Copy
pip install git+https://github.com/Sumedh1599/csmxauth.git
Usage
Once installed, you can import csmxauth into your Python project and start using its features.

Example:
python
Copy
import csmxauth

# Example: Creating a secure authentication token
auth_token = csmxauth.create_auth_token(user="username", password="yourpassword")
print(auth_token)

# Example: Validating the token
is_valid = csmxauth.validate_auth_token(auth_token)
print(is_valid)
Features:
Post-Quantum Secure Authentication: Future-proof authentication methods.
Cryptographic Strength: Built with industry-standard cryptography libraries like cryptography.
Simple API: Easy to integrate into your existing Python applications.
Token Generation: Generate secure authentication tokens for user sessions.
Token Validation: Validate tokens to ensure they are correct and haven't expired.
Documentation
create_auth_token(user: str, password: str) -> str: Generate a secure authentication token for the user based on their username and password.
validate_auth_token(token: str) -> bool: Validate an authentication token to check its authenticity.
